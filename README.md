# Text Summarization Transformer
## About
Created for UNI NLP course!

This project utilizes a transformer-based model for text summarization. The model is trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.

There are 2 attemps of creating my own summarizations models, but they did not work properly, but also there is an implementation of t5-small model that works great!
